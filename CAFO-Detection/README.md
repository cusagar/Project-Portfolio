Automated Detection of CAFOs Using Deep Learning & Computer Vision üõ∞Ô∏è

Welcome to my CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations) detection project using deep learning and aerial imagery. This project combines the power of image classification and object detection to identify CAFOs for environmental monitoring and regulatory use.

üìå Overview

This project leverages two deep learning approaches:

Image Classification using MobileNetV3 (SagarProject.ipynb)

Object Detection using YOLOv8 (YOLO.ipynb)

Each model provides a unique method for evaluating aerial images and contributes toward robust CAFO detection.

üß† Project Breakdown

üìò SagarProject.ipynb ‚Äì Image Classification using MobileNetV3

This notebook focuses on training a convolutional neural network to classify aerial images as CAFO or non-CAFO.

Steps Implemented:

Dataset located in Google Drive at: /content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/cafo_model_training_data

Extracted and unzipped .tar.gz image archives.

Processed and normalized images using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Constructed a CNN using MobileNetV3 (pretrained on ImageNet).

Fine-tuned the model using training data with data augmentation techniques.

Evaluated model accuracy using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Saved the trained model as an .h5 file.

Ran inference on test images and stored classified output in /content/drive/MyDrive/yolov8-CAFOS/inference/.

Output:

MobileNetV3.h5 classification model (available upon request)

Accuracy scores and confusion matrix

Folder containing test images with predicted class labels

üìó YOLO.ipynb ‚Äì Object Detection using YOLOv8

This notebook handles spatial detection using bounding boxes, training a YOLOv8 model on labeled aerial data.

Steps Implemented:

Dataset YAML config: /content/drive/MyDrive/yolov8-CAFOS/data/cafo.yaml

Bounding box labels: /content/drive/MyDrive/yolov8-CAFOS/data/cafo_model_training_data/split_by_class/

Converted CSV annotations into YOLO format.

Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Trained a YOLOv8 model from scratch.

Output the best model weights as best.pt.

Inferred on test images to generate bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.

Saved visual detection results to: /content/drive/MyDrive/yolov8-CAFOS/inference/

Output:

best.pt detection model (available upon request)
